                Cake will become dry, hard, and crumbly when too much flour is added. So, always use the precise amount of flour called for in the recipe. Try weighing your flour with a digital scale or gently spooning and levelling it into your measuring cup.
            </li>
            <li class="step">
                Always sift your dry ingredients in a large bowl before mixing in the liquids. This action will help break up any lumps or clumps that may form in dry ingredients, such as flour or baking soda, resulting in a smoother and more uniform texture in the final batter.
            </li>
            <li class="step">
                Follow the recipe to a tee when baking a cake. That is especially pivotal when it comes to mixing the batter. A good cake recipe will detail how long you should mix the batter to avoid producing too much gluten, which can result in a tough, dense, and crumbly cake. 
            </li>
            <li class="step">
                Please note that the temperature and timing may fluctuate depending on whether you are making cupcakes, a sheet cake, or cake layers in individual pans. When in doubt, always refer back to your recipe.
            </li>
            <li class="step">
                To keep cakes moist once they are out of the oven is to soak them in a syrup made of equal parts granulated sugar and water. You can also use coconut milk, evaporated milk, or flavoured liqueur. Apply the liquid with a pastry brush to ensure even distribution across the top and sides of the cake.
